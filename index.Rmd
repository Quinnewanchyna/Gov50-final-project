## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the relationship between how serving in the military can either amplify or hinder hawkish biases in foreign policy making. More specifically, I aim analyze this relationship by examining members of congress who have served in the military and their voting history on foreign policy-related measures, and cross-compare this data with members of congress from the same state who have not served in the military. I plan to include data from all 82 members of congress who have served in the military.
Within my research, my utmost goal is to see if a relationship exists between serving in the military and the experiences one may endure, and how this can potentially alter one's perception of international relations and hawkish engagement from a policy standpoint.
